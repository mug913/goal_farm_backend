This is the API Backend of a goal tracking application. The Front End repository is stored here:
https://github.com/mug913/goal_farm_frontend

Basic functionality at this time:

User Account creation and retrieval.

Goal creation / activity tracking by 24 hour cycle. To create a goal, click on any empty (gray) goal area.

If the goal has been activated in the last 24 hours it will display green, if not it will go red and then black until it is reactivated.
